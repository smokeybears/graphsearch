These files were created as part of a homework assignment, I've only included relivant graph search code here. In order to actually run the simulations download the whole project folder from  https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cs188websitecontent/projects/release/multiagent/v1/002/multiagent.zip

search.py - contains a barebones implementation of BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search and Astar. Implemenation starts at line 76

multiAgents.py - contains implementations of a minimax search with alphabeta pruning
